**What went wrong?**
We need to know what the actual problem to be solved is - obviously!

**How can we recreate the issue?**
Having solid steps to reproduce the problem helps a ton!
Please put it in terms of "Step 1: Boot, Step 2: Press this combination of keys: `alt + F20 + J`..."

**What do you think went wrong?**
If you have any vague suggestions or have investigated the issue and know roughly what's wrong, feel free to put it here. Otherwise, don't worry.
